# C++ Notes

## Program Structure

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello there, first c++ program" << std::endl;
  return (0);
}
```

- `#` in `#include <iostream>` is a preprocessor directive and it's processed before actual compilation.
- `include` keyword is used to import libraries.
  - standard library names are enclosed in `<>`
  - user-defined library names are enclosed in `""`
- every c++ program has a main function.

## Comments

- single line comments `// this is a one line comment`
- multi line comments

```c++
/*
this is a multi-line comment
1 ...
2 ...
*/
```
